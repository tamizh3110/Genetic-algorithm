# geneticalgorithm
Genetic algorithm library written in python. 
Genetic algorithm is an evolutionary algorithm that can be utilized to find optimal solutions.Here the program is solving the one-max problem where the overall objective is to get all one in a n-bit strings containing only 0 and 1.It can also solve the rastrigin problem but it was fine-tuned only for 16-bit strings not for a n-bit string.
